Far away in space, there's a small yellow sun. A little blue-green planet goes around it. People live on this planet, but they are not very happy. They like digital watches, but they still feel sad. They have lots of problems. Many think about money. But money isn't the problem. People are mean and unhappy. Some even think it was bad to leave the trees and the ocean.

One day, a girl in a cafe had a great idea. She knew how to make the world happy. It would really work this time. But before she could tell anyone, something bad happened. Her idea was lost. This story isn't about her. It's about that bad thing and what happened next.

It's also about a book. The book is called "The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy". It's not from Earth. No one on Earth knew about it. It's a very good book. It’s popular in space, more than other famous books. It tells you lots of things, even if some are wrong. It's cheaper than other books. And it says "Don't Panic" on the cover.

The story starts with a bad day. It starts with a house.

The house was on a hill. It looked over some farms. It wasn't a special house. It was about thirty years old. Arthur Dent lived in this house. It was special to him because he lived there. He moved there because London made him worried. He worked in radio. He thought it was interesting, even if his friends didn't.

Arthur didn't know that the city wanted to knock down his house. They wanted to build a road instead.

On Thursday morning, Arthur felt bad. He woke up, walked around, and saw a bulldozer. He went to the bathroom. He brushed his teeth. He looked in the mirror. He saw the bulldozer again. He shaved. He went to the kitchen. He wanted coffee.


Arthur woke up with a headache. He felt bad. He thought he drank too much last night. He remembered the pub. He was angry. He told people about a new road. Nobody knew about it. He thought it was silly. He drank water. It would be okay, he thought.

He saw a big yellow thing outside. It was a bulldozer. He went outside. He lay down in front of it.

A man came. His name was Mr. Prosser. He was fat and nervous. He worked for the council. He was in charge of knocking down Arthur's house.

"Get up, Mr. Dent," he said. "You can't win. You can't stay there forever."

Arthur stayed on the ground. "I will," he said.

Mr. Prosser was worried. "This road needs to be built," he said.

"I never heard about it," said Arthur. "Why?"

Mr. Prosser didn't know why. "It just does," he said. "Roads need to be built."

He wanted to live far away. He wanted a cottage and a pub. He was uncomfortable. Someone made a mistake, he thought.

Mr. Prosser said Arthur could complain before.

"When?" asked Arthur. "Yesterday, a man came to my house. He said he would knock it down! He cleaned windows first and then told me!"

"The plans were there for months," said Mr. Prosser.

"I went to see them yesterday," Arthur said.


Arthur liked his house. A man named Mr. Prosser wanted to build a road through it. Arthur was not happy. Mr. Prosser said the plans were on display. Arthur found them in a locked room with a warning about a leopard.

Mr. Prosser got angry. He thought about running Arthur over with a bulldozer.

Arthur had a friend named Ford Prefect. Arthur didn't know Ford was from another planet. Ford said he was an actor. He picked the name "Ford Prefect". He didn't research Earth very well.

Ford wasn't very tall. He had ginger hair. He looked a bit strange. People thought he was odd. He didn't blink much. He smiled too much.

Ford liked to go to parties. He got drunk and argued with scientists. He looked at the sky. He said he was looking for flying saucers. He said he wanted green ones.

Ford got very drunk. He told girls the color of the saucers didn't matter. He asked police for directions to Betelgeuse.

Ford was really looking for any flying saucer. Green was the color of Betelgeuse ships. Ford had been on Earth for fifteen years. He thought Earth was boring.

Ford wanted a flying saucer to come. He knew how to get a ride. He was stranded.


Ford Prefect knew a lot about space. He worked for a book called The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Arthur was lying in mud. He was trying to stop his house from being knocked down. A man named Mr. Prosser wanted to build something else there. Bulldozers were waiting.

Life was normal for Arthur and Mr. Prosser. Arthur stayed in the mud. Mr. Prosser tried to trick Arthur. The bulldozer drivers drank coffee.

Ford came to see Arthur. “Hello Arthur,” Ford said. “Are you busy?”

Arthur said he was busy. He had to stop the bulldozers.

Ford didn’t understand sarcasm. He asked Arthur to talk somewhere.

Arthur asked, “What?”

Ford looked at the sky. He pulled Arthur down. “We have to talk,” he said.

“Fine,” said Arthur.

“And drink,” said Ford. “It’s important.” He wanted to go to the pub.

“That man wants to knock my house down!” Arthur shouted.

Ford looked confused. “He can do it while you’re gone, right?”

Arthur didn’t want him to.

“I have to tell you something important,” Ford said. “We need a drink.”

Ford stared at Arthur. Arthur felt like going to the pub. Ford knew a strange drinking game.

The game was like wrestling. Two people sit at a table. Each has a drink. There is a bottle between them. They try to pour the drink into the other person's glass. Then that person has to drink it.

The drink was strong. It made people weak. The loser had to do something silly.

Ford wanted to lose. He looked at Arthur. Arthur thought he wanted to go to the pub.

“What about my house?” Arthur asked.

Ford looked at Mr. Prosser. He had an idea. “He wants to knock your house down?”

“Yes,” said Arthur.

“And he can’t because you’re there?”

“Yes.”

“We can fix that,” Ford said. He called to Mr. Prosser. Mr. Prosser was talking to the bulldozer drivers. He looked surprised to see Arthur with someone.


“Has Mr. Dent made sense yet?”
Ford asked, “Let’s say he hasn’t.”
Mr. Prosser sighed.
Ford added, “Let’s say he stays here all day.”
“So?” asked Mr. Prosser.
“So your workers will stand around all day?”
“Maybe,” said Mr. Prosser.
“If they will anyway, he doesn't need to lie here.”
“What?”
“He doesn’t need to be here,” Ford said.
Mr. Prosser thought. “Well, no, not really.” He was confused.
Ford said, “Let's pretend he is here. He and I can go to the pub for a bit.”
Mr. Prosser thought this was crazy. “That sounds good,” he said, confused.
“You can go later too,” Ford said.
“Thank you,” said Mr. Prosser, not knowing what to do. He fiddled with his hat. He thought he won.

“Lie here,” Ford told Mr. Prosser.
“What?” said Mr. Prosser.
“Someone must lie in front of the machines. Or they will destroy Mr. Dent’s house.”
“What?” Mr. Prosser said again.
“Mr. Dent will stop lying here if you take his place.”
“What are you talking about?” asked Arthur. Ford told him to be quiet.
“You want me to lie there?” Mr. Prosser said.
“Yes.”
“In front of the machine?”
“Yes.”
“Instead of Mr. Dent.”
“Yes.”
“In the mud.”
“In the mud.”

Mr. Prosser felt better. This made sense to him. He sighed.
“You will take Mr. Dent to the pub?”
“Yes,” said Ford.
Mr. Prosser stepped forward. “Promise?”
“Promise,” said Ford. He turned to Arthur. “Get up. Let him lie down.”
Arthur stood up, dazed.
Ford told Mr. Prosser to sit in the mud. He felt like life was a strange dream.
Ford looked at Mr. Prosser. “Don’t knock down Mr. Dent’s house while he is gone.”
“Never,” said Mr. Prosser. He lay down. He closed his eyes. He was upset. His head was full of noise.
Ford knew it didn’t matter if Arthur’s house was destroyed.
Arthur was worried. “Can we trust him?” he said.
“I trust him,” said Ford. “Come on, I need a drink.”

Chapter 2
The Encyclopedia Galactica says alcohol is a liquid made from sugar. It makes people drunk.
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy also talks about alcohol.


The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy says the best drink is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. It feels like a lemon and gold brick smashed your brain. The Guide tells where to find it and how to make it. You need Ol’ Janx Spirit, water from Santraginus V, Arcturan Mega-gin, Fallian marsh gas, Qualactin Hypermint, an Algolian Suntiger tooth, and Zamphuor. Add an olive. Drink carefully!

The Hitch Hiker's Guide sells better than the Encyclopedia Galactica.

Ford Prefect went to a bar. He ordered six beers. "The world's about to end," he said.

The barman didn't believe him. He talked about the weather and a soccer game. Ford said there was no point. The barman gave them the beers.

Arthur smiled at everyone. No one understood.

A man wanted their beer. Ford scared him away. Ford paid with a five-pound note. "Keep the change," he said. "You have ten minutes to spend it."

Arthur asked what was happening. Ford told him to drink.

"Why three beers?" Arthur asked.

"Muscle relaxant," Ford said.

Arthur felt confused. "Has the world always been like this?"

Ford said he wasn't from Earth. He was from a planet near Betelgeuse.

Arthur didn't know what to say.

Ford said, "Drink up. The world's about to end."

Arthur smiled weakly. The pub frowned.

"This must be Thursday," Arthur said. "I never get Thursdays."

Above Earth, big yellow things moved silently. They were huge, like buildings.


Big yellow things were in space near Earth. People on Earth didn't see them. Only a small machine noticed.

Ford Prefect had this machine. It was called a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It was in his bag.

Ford's bag was full of cool stuff. He had scripts for plays. He had an Electronic Thumb. It was a black rod. He also had a calculator-like thing. It had many buttons. The screen showed lots of pages. It said "Don't Panic" on the cover.

This calculator was really a book. It was The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The book was small because a normal book would be too big.

Ford had pens, a notepad, and a towel in his bag.

The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy says towels are important. A towel is very useful. You can use it to stay warm. You can lie on it. You can sleep under it. You can use it for fighting. You can hide from monsters with it. You can use it to signal for help.

A towel also makes people think you are smart. People think you have everything you need if you have a towel. They will help you.

People even have a saying. If someone has a towel, they are "hoopy" and "frood". This means they are really cool.

The Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic blinked faster. The yellow things spread out in space. Someone at Jodrell Bank wanted tea.

Ford asked Arthur, "You got a towel with you?"
Arthur was drinking beer. He looked at Ford. "Why?" he asked.


"What? Should I have?" Arthur wasn't surprised anymore.

Ford told him to drink. A loud crash came from outside. Arthur jumped up. "What's that?"

"Don't worry," Ford said. "They haven't started yet."

"Thank God," Arthur said.

"It's probably just your house," Ford said.

"What?" Arthur ran to the window. "They're knocking down my house! Why am I in the pub?"

"It doesn't matter," Ford said. "Let them."

"Fun?" Arthur shouted. He ran out, waving his beer glass. "Stop! You vandals!"

Ford needed to follow him. He asked the barman for peanuts. The barman gave them to him. Ford paid extra.

The barman felt strange. He felt a huge sense of distance. Ford was from far away.

"Are you serious?" the barman whispered. "The world's going to end?"

"Yes," Ford said.

"This afternoon?"

"Yes," Ford said. "In two minutes."

"Can we do anything?"

"No," Ford said, putting peanuts in his pockets.

Someone laughed. A man next to Ford spoke. "I thought we should lie down."

"If you like," Ford said.

"Will that help?" the barman asked.

"No," Ford said. "Excuse me." He left.

The bar was quiet. Then the laughing man laughed again.

The barman said, "Last orders, please."

The bulldozers moved faster.

Arthur ran to his house. He didn't notice the cold or the wind. He saw the bulldozers.

"You barbarians!" he yelled. "I'll sue you!"

Ford ran after him.

"I'll jump on all the bits!" Arthur yelled.

Arthur didn't see the men running. He didn't see Mr. Prosser looking at the sky.


Mr. Prosser saw big yellow things fly in the sky. Arthur ran and shouted. He tripped and fell. He looked up. “What’s that?” he yelled.

The yellow things made loud noises. They went away. Then another one came. People didn't know what to do. They ran into houses. They ran out of houses. Cars crashed. The noise went everywhere.

One man stood still. He was sad. He had plugs in his ears. He knew what was happening. His machine had warned him. It was the Vogons!

He opened his bag. He threw out some books. He knew where his towel was.

Everything went quiet. Big ships hung in the air. They were huge. People were shocked.

Then, a voice came. It came from every radio and TV. "People of Earth," the voice said. "This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz."

"We need to build a road. Your planet is in the way. We will destroy it in two minutes. Thank you."

The voice stopped. People were scared. They ran, but there was nowhere to go.

The Vogons spoke again. "You knew about this. The plans were on Alpha Centauri for 50 years. You could have complained."

The voice stopped again. The ships turned. A door opened on each ship.

Someone sent a message to the Vogons. The Vogons answered. The voice was angry. "You've never been to Alpha Centauri? It's only four light years away!"


The Vogons didn’t care about the Earth. They said Earth people were not interested in important things. Then, the Vogons destroyed Earth with big beams of light. Their ships flew away.

Far away, Zaphod Beeblebrox was going somewhere. He was the President of the Galaxy. He was on the planet Damogran. It was hot and far away. Nobody knew about it. Damogran was where the Heart of Gold was hidden.

Zaphod’s boat went fast on the water. Damogran was made of islands with lots of water in between. This made it a lonely planet. That’s why the Heart of Gold was built there. It was secret.

Zaphod was going to the island called France. It was a funny name. The Heart of Gold was going to be shown to everyone.

It was also a big day for Zaphod. He became President for this day. People were surprised he wanted to be President. They thought he was crazy.

Zaphod grinned. He knew what he was doing. Only a few people knew how the Galaxy was run. They picked Zaphod to be President.

Zaphod sped up the boat. He wanted to show everyone his plan. It was also his birthday. But that wasn’t important.

Zaphod was happy. He put his arms back. He used an extra arm to steer. It helped him ski-box better.

The President doesn’t have much power. He just makes people pay attention. Zaphod was good at that. He even went to jail for lying. Most people think a computer makes the big decisions.


They were very wrong. Zaphod said he was cool, but he was very nervous.

The island was long and thin. It was near a big bay. One side had tall cliffs. The land went down to the other side.

People waited on top of the cliffs. They were scientists who built something special. They looked like people, robots, and aliens. They wore colorful coats. One was just a color! They were excited to see a man with an orange belt.

The orange belt meant he was the President. But the President didn't really have power. He just got people's attention. Zaphod was good at that.

A fast boat zoomed into the bay. It went fast on the water. It made big splashes. Zaphod liked making a show.

He turned the boat and stopped by the cliffs. He waved to everyone. Three billion people watched him on TV. He was funny to watch.

Zaphod waved again. He knew today would be a big surprise.

A robot camera showed his face. He had two heads and three arms. His hair was messy. He didn't shave well.

A big clear bubble floated next to the boat. Inside was a red sofa. The bubble moved, but the sofa stayed still. It was all for show.

Zaphod went into the bubble and sat down. He brushed his knee. He looked around and smiled. He might scream soon.

Water bubbled under the bubble. The bubble went up, up, up. It shot water down. It went high to the cliffs.

Zaphod smiled. He liked this way to travel. It was silly but fun.

At the top, the bubble stopped. Zaphod got out. He wore his orange belt. Everyone clapped.

The President of the Galaxy was here. He waited for the clapping to stop. Then he said, "Hi."

A robot tried to give him a speech. But the speech was wet in the sea.


Pages of a book were used by an eagle to build a nest. The nest was hard to break. The eagle did not want baby eagles to survive.

Zaphod was there. He said "Hi" to everyone. People smiled. He saw Trillian. She was a girl he met. She had dark hair and brown eyes. She wore a red scarf and brown dress. Zaphod said "Hi honey" to her. She smiled a little.

Zaphod said "Hi" to the press. He would say something important soon. An official pushed a button. A big white dome opened. It showed a starship. It was white and shaped like a shoe. It was very beautiful. Inside was a gold box. It was called the Heart of Gold. It made the ship special.

Zaphod said "Wow" to the ship. He said it again to annoy the press. Trillian knew he was showing off.

Zaphod said, "That is really amazing. I think I’d like to steal it."

People laughed. The news people wrote it down. Zaphod grinned. He felt bad. He had a bomb in his pocket. He threw the bomb and ran away.

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was ugly. He had a big nose and green skin. His skin was thick. He lived in the sea. But he never swam.

The Vogons were ugly. They never changed. They were stubborn. Evolution did not like them.


The Vogons didn't like how they were made. So, they fixed themselves with surgery. The planet Vogsphere tried to make up for making Vogons. It made cool crabs with shiny shells. Vogons smashed the shells with hammers to eat the crab. It made tall, pretty trees. Vogons cut them down to cook the crab. It made gazelle-like animals with soft fur. Vogons sat on them, even though they broke their backs.

The Vogons found a way to travel in space. They all moved to Megabrantis. Now, they are the strong workers in the Galaxy. They try to learn and be fancy. But they are still like their old, mean ancestors. Every year, they get crabs from their planet. They smash them with hammers while they are drunk.

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a very mean Vogon. He didn't like hitchhikers. Ford Prefect was hidden on Jeltz's ship. He knew Vogons were dangerous. He was thankful to the Dentrassis.

The Dentrassis were cooks for the Vogons. They liked Vogon money, but they hated Vogons. They only liked seeing Vogons get mad. Ford Prefect was safe because of the Dentrassis. Otherwise, Vogons would have destroyed him.

Ford Prefect's real name was hard to say. His dad died because Ford couldn't say it. Kids called him a name that meant "boy who can't explain the Hrung."

Ford heard a noise. He lit a match. He saw a shape on the floor. He put out the match. He took out peanuts.

Ford said, "I bought some peanuts."

Arthur Dent moved. He groaned.

Ford said, "Here, have some. You lost salt and protein in the beam."

"Whhhrrrr…" said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes.

"It's dark," he said.

"Yes," said Ford Prefect. "It's dark."

"No light," said Arthur Dent. "Dark, no light."

Ford thought people said obvious things too much. He thought they were exercising their lips or stopping their brains from working.


Ford changed his mind about people. He liked them after all. But he worried they didn’t know enough. “Yes, no light,” Ford told Arthur. He gave Arthur peanuts. “How do you feel?” Ford asked.

“Like I might faint,” said Arthur.

Ford looked at him. It was dark.

“Where are we?” Arthur asked.

Ford stood up. “We’re safe,” he said.

“Oh,” said Arthur.

“We are in a spaceship,” said Ford. “A Vogon spaceship.”

“Oh,” said Arthur. “That doesn’t sound safe.”

Ford lit a match. Shadows moved. Arthur was scared. Strange shapes were all around. It smelled bad. A noise bothered him.

“How did we get here?” Arthur asked.

“We got a ride,” said Ford.

“What?” said Arthur. “Did we stick out our thumbs?”

“Kind of,” said Ford. “It was a special thumb. And the ride was far away.”

“And a monster gave us a ride?”

“Yes, a green one.”

“Okay,” said Arthur. “Can I go home?”

“No,” said Ford. Then he found the light.

“Cover your eyes!” he said.

Arthur gasped. “Is this a spaceship?”

A Vogon named Jeltz was grumpy. He liked to shout. He wanted someone to bother him. He sat down hard. He wanted the chair to break. It didn’t.

“Go away!” he yelled at a guard. The guard left fast. He didn’t want to give Jeltz news. The news was about a new spaceship drive. It was very good news. It meant Vogons might not be needed.

Another door opened. A furry creature came in with food. It looked very happy.

Jeltz was happy it was happy. It meant something bad was happening.

Ford and Arthur looked around the room.

“What do you think?” Ford asked.

“It’s messy,” said Arthur.

Ford frowned. “This is where the Dentrassi sleep. It’s a working ship.”

“I thought they were Vogons,” said Arthur.

“The Vogons run the ship. The Dentrassi cook and let us on,” said Ford.

“I’m confused,” said Arthur.

“Look at this,” said Ford. He sat on a bed. Arthur touched it. He sat too.

Ford gave Arthur a book.

“What is it?” Arthur asked.

“The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. It tells you everything.”

Arthur looked at the cover. “Don’t Panic,” it said. “That’s helpful.”

“I’ll show you,” said Ford. He took the book.

“Press this,” he said.

A small screen lit up. Words moved on the screen.

“You want to know about Vogons,” Ford said. He typed. “There we are.”

The words “Vogon Constructor Fleets” glowed.

Ford pressed a button. Words moved. The book also spoke.


Arthur reads a book about Vogons. The book says Vogons are mean. They are bad-tempered and don't help people. It's hard to get Vogons to give you a drink. It is best not to let Vogons read poems.

Arthur is confused. He asks Ford how they got a ride on a Vogon ship. Ford says the book is old. He is writing a new book. Vogons have Dentrassi cooks now. Dentrassi like to help hitchhikers. They do it to bother the Vogons.

Arthur asks who the Dentrassi are. Ford says they are great cooks. They don't care about anything else. They help people get on Vogon ships.

Ford says he was stuck on Earth for 15 years. He got there with a "teaser." Teasers are rich kids. They fly to planets that don't know about space. They land and act silly to confuse people.

Arthur asks what he is doing on the ship. Ford says he saved him from Earth. Arthur asks what happened to Earth. Ford says it was destroyed. Arthur is upset.

Ford tells Arthur not to panic. He tells Arthur to have fun. He says Arthur needs a fish in his ear.

Ford shows Arthur a jar with a small yellow fish. Arthur is confused. He wants something normal.

Suddenly, a loud noise comes. It sounds like someone trying to talk with wolves. Ford says it's the Vogon captain talking. Ford tells Arthur to listen. Arthur doesn't speak Vogon. Ford says to put the fish in his ear.

Ford puts the fish in Arthur's ear. Arthur feels something slimy. He tries to take it out. Then, he is amazed. He understands the Vogon language.


Arthur looked at dots on paper. He needed new glasses. A weird noise turned into words. It was Chapter 6.

The noise said, "Howl gargle slurp. Have fun." Then, "This is the captain. We have stowaways. You are not welcome. I am important. I'll kick you off the ship. Maybe I'll read you my poems."

"We go to Barnard’s Star. No one leaves the ship. I am sad. So, you can’t have fun." The noise stopped.

Arthur was on the floor. He was scared. "Charming guy," he said. "I would forbid my daughter to marry him."

Ford said, "They are not cool. Get ready for hyperspace. It's like being drunk."

"What's wrong with drunk?" Arthur asked.

"Ask water."

Arthur thought. "Ford," he said. "What's this fish in my ear?"

"It translates. It's a Babel fish. Read the book." Ford gave him the book. He got ready for hyperspace.

Arthur's mind went crazy. His eyes flipped. His feet leaked from his head. The room disappeared. He slid into his bellybutton. They were in hyperspace.

The book said, "The Babel fish is small and yellow. It eats thoughts. It makes you understand any language. It's so weird it proves God might not exist."

"God said, 'I won't prove I exist. Proof ruins faith.' But the fish proves He exists. So, He disappears!"

"Man said, 'Easy!' He proved wrong things and died."

"Some people think it’s silly. The fish made wars because everyone understood each other."

Arthur groaned. Hyperspace didn't kill him. He was far from Earth. Earth was gone. He thought of his family. Nothing.


Arthur was sad. He thought about Earth. It was gone. He felt trapped in the spaceship. He tried to think of America. He couldn't. He thought of New York. Nothing. He thought of money. A little sad. He thought of movies. Very sad. He thought of hamburgers. He fainted.

He woke up crying for his mom.

He stood up. "Ford!"

Ford looked up. He liked space travel. "Yeah?"

"What does your book say about Earth?" asked Arthur.

"Okay." Ford gave him the book.

Arthur looked. "It's wrong! It says 'Harmless'!"

Ford said, "Space is big. The book is small. Nobody knew Earth."

"Did you fix it?" Arthur asked.

"Yes. I sent a new story about Earth."

"What does it say now?"

"Mostly harmless," Ford said.

"Mostly harmless!" Arthur shouted.

"Be quiet!" Ford said. "We are in trouble."

They heard loud steps.

"Dentrassi?" Arthur whispered.

"No, boots," said Ford.

Someone knocked.

"Who is it?" Arthur asked.

"Maybe Vogons to throw us out," said Ford. "Or worse."

"What's worse?"

"The captain might read us his poetry," said Ford.

Vogon poetry is very bad. Grunthos's poem made people sick. Paula Jennings' poetry died with Earth.

The Vogon, Jeltz, smiled. He liked being mean.

Arthur and Ford were strapped to chairs. The chairs made the poetry feel worse.

Arthur was scared.


He didn't like what was happening. A Vogon started reading a bad poem. "Oh frettled gruntbuggly..." it began. Ford felt awful. Arthur didn't like it either.

"Thy micturations are to me | As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee." Ford yelled in pain. Arthur rolled around.

The Vogon kept reading. "Groop I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes." Ford screamed. He went limp. Arthur still rolled.

The Vogon stopped. He said, "Die in space, or tell me my poem is good!"

Ford gasped for air. Arthur said, "I liked it!"

Ford was shocked. The Vogon was surprised. "Oh good..." he said.

Arthur said the poem had good images. Ford helped. They said it had a good message.

The Vogon looked at them. He didn't believe them. "So, I want to be loved?" he asked.

Ford nervously said yes. The Vogon stood up.

"No! I write to show how mean I am. I'll throw you out! Guard!"

A big Vogon guard grabbed them. "You can't!" Ford yelled. "We're writing a book!"

"Resistance is useless!" the guard shouted.

The captain watched. Arthur yelled, "I don't want to die with a headache!"

The guard grabbed them. He took them away. The steel door closed.

The captain thought about the poem. "Death's too good for them," he said.

The guard dragged them down a hallway. "This is great!" Arthur said sarcastically.

"Don't worry," Ford said. "I'll think of something." He didn't sound sure.

"Resistance is useless!" the guard yelled again.

"Stop saying that!" Ford said. "Be positive!"

Arthur said, "You haven't even had your planet destroyed today!"


Arthur had a bad day. He woke up thinking it would be nice. Now he was on an alien ship, far from Earth. Earth was gone! A big alien was holding him. The alien was a Vogon.

"Stop yelling," Ford said.

"I'm not yelling," Arthur said. "I'm just surprised."

"You're being silly," Ford said. "Be quiet!"

The Vogon yelled, "Stop fighting!"

"Be quiet yourself," Ford said. He looked at the Vogon. "Do you like doing this?"

The Vogon looked confused. "Like what?"

"Like yelling and pushing people?" Ford asked.

The Vogon thought hard. "The hours are okay," he said.

"So they must be," Ford said. Arthur was very confused.

"Ford, what are you doing?" he asked.

"Just talking," Ford said. "So, are the hours good?"

The Vogon thought again. "Well, most of the time it's not fun. But I like the shouting." He yelled, "Stop fighting!"

"Yes, you are good at that," Ford said. "But if it's not fun, why do you do it?"

"Um…" the Vogon said. "I don't know. My aunt said being a spaceship guard was a good job."

"See, Arthur?" Ford said. "He has problems too."

Arthur thought he had bigger problems. The Vogon was hurting him.

"Try to understand," Ford said. "His job is pushing people off ships."

"And shouting," the Vogon said.

"Yes, and he doesn't know why!" Ford said.

The Vogon thought about it. "Well, what else can I do?"

"Stop doing it!" Ford said. "Tell them you quit."

The Vogon didn't like that idea.

"Wait," Ford said. "It could be fun. There's more to life!"

But the Vogon grabbed them harder. He wanted to throw them off the ship.

"I have to shout some more," the Vogon said.

Ford was still trying to talk. "But listen!"

"Ugh," said Arthur.

"There's music and art!" Ford said.

"Stop fighting!" yelled the Vogon. "If I shout enough, I can get a better job. So, I need to keep shouting."

They got to a big metal door. The Vogon opened it.

"Thanks for talking," the Vogon said. "Bye!" He threw Ford and Arthur into the room. Arthur was gasping for air.


Ford tried to stop the door. He asked the guard if he knew Beethoven. The guard did not. The door closed.

Ford and Arthur were stuck in a room. It was small and round.

“We are trapped,” Arthur said.

“Yes,” Ford said. “I had a plan, but it needed us to be outside.”

“What happens now?” Arthur asked.

“The door will open. We will go into space. We will run out of air,” Ford said. He hummed a song.

“We are going to die,” Arthur said.

“Wait!” Ford yelled. He pretended to see a switch. “Just kidding,” he said. He kept humming.

Arthur wished he listened to his mom.

A motor started. The door opened. Air rushed out. Ford and Arthur flew into space.

The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a book. It has lots of information.

The book says space is very, very big. It is much bigger than you think.

The book also says the planet Bethselamin is picky about poop. If you poop too much, they take weight from you.

Space is so big, light takes a long time to travel. It takes minutes to get to Earth. It takes years to get to other stars. It takes many years to get across the Galaxy.

The book says you can hold your breath in space for thirty seconds.


Ford and Arthur were in big trouble in space. A computer saw a door open by itself. Reason was not around. A tiny hole opened in space. It was very short and small, but very long. Paper hats and party balloons came out. Some small people died. Fried eggs fell on a hungry land. One man ate them and died.

The hole made the past change. Some tiny things started sticking together. They learned to copy themselves. This made problems on planets. That's how life started.

Ford and Arthur fell onto a road. They were gasping. "I saved us!" said Ford. "Sure," said Arthur. "I found a ship to save us!" said Ford. The world looked strange. Things flashed by. "The chances were super small," said Arthur. "It worked!" said Ford. "What ship is this?" asked Arthur. "I don't know," said Ford. "Me neither," said Arthur.

The world jumped around. Arthur and Ford opened their eyes. "It looks like a beach!" said Arthur. "Good! I thought I was crazy," said Ford. "Maybe we both are," said Arthur.

"Do you think it's a beach?" asked Ford. "Yes," said Arthur. "Me too." "We must be crazy." "Good day to be crazy."

"Yes," said a weird man. "Who was that?" asked Arthur. "Just someone," said Ford. They sat down. Big kids jumped around. Horses flew in the sky. "Something is weird," said Arthur.

"The sea stays still, and the buildings move?" said Ford. "Yes, that's weird."


"Something strange is happening," said a man. The town split into pieces. Weird music played. Doughnuts appeared. Fish fell from the sky. Two friends, Arthur and Ford, ran away.

They went through strange things like walls of sound. They heard a girl's voice. She said, "Two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling." Ford didn't know what it meant.

Custard fell on them. Arthur asked about the voice. Ford said it sounded like a measurement of chance. He thought they were on a spaceship. Arthur joked about it not being a good part of the ship.

Things got weirder. Arthur felt his body change. He lost an arm. He worried about his watch. He saw Ford turning into a penguin.

The voice spoke again. "Two to the power of seventy-five thousand to one against and falling." Ford, as a penguin, wanted to know what was going on. The voice said, "You are safe."

Arthur got his arm back. "Two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling," the voice said.

Ford asked if they should be told something. The voice cleared its throat. "Welcome to the Starship Heart of Gold," it said.

The voice said not to worry about strange things. They were saved from death with very low odds. The ship was making things normal. "Two to the power of twenty thousand to one against and falling," it said.

Ford and Arthur were in a pink room. Ford was happy. It was a ship with a special drive called the Infinite Improbability Drive. He had heard stories about it. Arthur was trying to keep the door closed. Tiny furry hands came through the cracks. Small voices chattered.

Arthur said, "Ford! Monkeys outside want to talk about their play!"

The Infinite Improbability Drive is how they travel far in space quickly. It was found by luck and made useful on a planet called Damogran.


People knew how to make a little bit of impossible happen. They used a special brain and a thing that moved atoms. It was like a fun trick at parties. It made people's clothes jump.

Some scientists didn't like it. They thought it was silly. They wanted to make a machine that could travel very far in space. But it was too hard. They said it was impossible.

One day, a student cleaned the lab. He had an idea. If the machine was almost impossible, it was still a little bit possible. He could use the party trick machine to make it. He added tea for power!

He made the impossible machine! It worked. He got a prize. Then, the angry scientists chased him. They didn't like him being so smart.

The spaceship, Heart of Gold, had a special room. It was very clean and new. It had big screens and computers. A robot sat in the corner. It looked a little broken.

Zaphod was walking around. He was excited. Trillian was reading numbers. She said everything was normal. But something was strange.

Trillian said they picked up people in space. Zaphod was mad. They were running from the police! He didn't want to help hitchhikers.

Trillian said the people were floating in space. They would have died. Zaphod didn't want that. He just didn't think it was smart. Trillian moved his hand away from the buttons. He could break the ship. Zaphod was good at being wild, but not at machines. Trillian thought he never understood things. She said to Zaphod "You wouldn’t want them to have died would you?"


“But maybe someone else picked them up.”

“If you waited, they’d be dead.”

“You’d let them die?”

“I didn’t pick them up.”

“Who did?”

“The ship did. By itself.”

“Huh?”

“When we were using the Improbability Drive.”

“That’s amazing!”

“It's just not very likely.”

Trillian said, “Don’t worry. They're just people. I’ll send the robot to get them. Hey Marvin!”

The robot, Marvin, looked up slowly. He walked slowly to Trillian. “I’m sad,” he said.

Zaphod groaned.

Trillian said, “Here’s a job to cheer you up.”

“It won’t work. My mind is too big,” Marvin said.

“Marvin! Do it!” Trillian said.

“Okay. What do you want me to do?”

“Get the aliens from bay two and bring them here.”

Marvin was not happy. “Just that?”

“Yes,” Trillian said.

“I won’t like it,” Marvin said.

Zaphod yelled, “Just do it!”

“Okay,” Marvin said sadly.

“Good!” Zaphod said.

Marvin looked at him. “Am I making you sad?”

“No, Marvin. It’s fine,” Trillian said.

“Are you sure you don’t mind?”

“No, Marvin. It’s fine.”

Marvin looked at him. “Life,” he said. “Don’t talk about life.”

He walked out. The door closed.

“I can’t stand that robot,” Trillian said.

A robot is a machine that does work for people. The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation says robots are fun friends. Other people think the company is bad.

Ford and Arthur were in the ship. It was new.

“The ship is new,” Ford said.

“How do you know?” Arthur asked.

“I found this book. It says the ship can go to every place in the Universe!” Ford showed Arthur the book. “It's amazing!”

Ford read about the ship. Arthur listened a little. Then he pushed a red button. The panel said, “Don’t press this button again.”

“They talk about the ship’s robots,” Ford said. “They have a new thing called GPP.”

“What is GPP?” Arthur asked.


"What's that?" someone asked.

"It says Genuine People Personalities," another said.

"Sounds bad," said Arthur.

A robot behind them said, "It is bad." He sounded sad. His name was Marvin.

"It's all bad," Marvin said. "Don't talk about it." He showed them a door.

"The doors are happy," Marvin said, making fun of the door. "They like to open and close."

The door closed. It made a happy noise. Marvin hated it. He wanted to hurt it. But he was too sad to care.

"Come on," Marvin said. "I have to take you to the bridge. I'm smart but they make me do this."

Ford asked, "Who owns this ship?"

Marvin ignored him. "Watch the door," he said. "It's going to open again."

The door opened. Marvin walked through.

"Come on," he said.

They followed. The door closed happily.

"Thanks, Sirius Cybernetics Corporation," Marvin said. "They wanted to make robots with feelings. I'm one. It's awful."

Ford and Arthur felt bad for him.

"I hate that door," Marvin said. "I'm not taking you anywhere, am I?"

"Who owns it?" Ford asked again.

"No one," Marvin said. "It was stolen."

"Stolen?" Ford asked.

"By Zaphod Beeblebrox," Marvin said.

Ford was shocked. He couldn't believe it. "Zaphod Beeblebrox?" he asked.

"Did I say something wrong?" Marvin asked. "I'm so depressed. Here's another door. Life is bad."

"Ford, are you okay?" Arthur asked.

"Did the robot say Zaphod Beeblebrox?" Ford asked.

Zaphod was listening to the radio in another part of the ship. It was hard to use. You had to wave at it.

Zaphod waved. The station changed. It was the news.

"Zaphod Beeblebrox stole a spaceship!" the news said. "Is he crazy? He invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. He's been called the worst-dressed person. What's going on?"


He said, "He's just a guy," but a pencil flew. Zaphod looked at Trillian. She threw it. "Why?" he asked.

Trillian typed. "I thought of something," she said.

"More important than me?" Zaphod asked.

"Yes," she said. "Drop your ego."

"Never!" Zaphod said, but then laughed. "Okay, what guys?"

"The ones we picked up," Trillian said. "In sector ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha."

Zaphod blinked. "Does that mean anything?" Trillian asked.

"Um... what's a Z?" Zaphod asked.

Trillian knew Zaphod acted stupid. Was he really stupid, or pretending? He wanted people puzzled, not mad.

She showed him a star map. "There," she said. "The same place we found me."

"Hey, yeah!" Zaphod said. "That's weird. We should have gone to the Horsehead Nebula. It's nowhere."

"Improbability Drive," Trillian said. "We go everywhere."

"It's a big chance," Zaphod said. "Finding someone there? Computer!"

The ship's computer talked. "Hi there!" it said. It printed a tiny paper that said, "Hi there!"

"Oh God," Zaphod said. He hated the computer.

"I can help you!" the computer said.

"No, thanks. Paper is better," Zaphod said.

"Okay," the computer said.

Zaphod and Trillian looked at the numbers. "What was their chance of rescue?" Zaphod asked.

"Very small," Trillian said.

"But for us, it was small too!" Zaphod said.

Trillian typed more numbers. "Yes," she said.

"That's a big Improbability," Zaphod said. "Something big is happening."

Zaphod threw the pencil. "I can't figure it out," he said. "Computer!"

The computer talked again. "Hello there!" it said. "I'm here to help!"

"Shut up and figure this out," Zaphod said.

"Okay," the computer said. "A probability forecast..."


Zaphod looked worried. Trillian saw a telephone number on the screen. She said, "Did it say telephone number?"

Marvin the robot walked with Arthur and Ford. Marvin said his parts hurt. He stopped at a door. "We're at the bridge," he said. The door opened. "Thank you," it said.

Marvin went inside. He said, "Want to see aliens?" Another voice said, "Show them in."

Arthur and Ford went in. A man was in a chair, picking his teeth. Ford said, "Zaphod! Nice stolen ship."

Arthur was surprised. "You know him?" he asked Ford.
Ford said, "This is my friend, Arthur. Zaphod saved him when his planet blew up."

"Hi Arthur," Zaphod said.

Ford said, "And this is my cousin, Zaphod Beeblebrox."

"We've met," Arthur said.

Ford was confused. "What?"

"I said we've met," Arthur said.

Zaphod looked surprised.

Ford got angry. "How do you know him?"

Arthur said, "We've met, Zaphod. Or should I say... Phil?"

"What!" Ford shouted.

"You'll have to remind me," Zaphod said.

"It was at a party," Arthur said.

"Oh," Zaphod said.

Ford looked at Arthur and Zaphod. "What?" he asked Zaphod.

Arthur said, "A party six months ago. On Earth."

"Oh," Zaphod said, "that party."


"Were you on that bad planet too?" Arthur asked.

"No," Zaphod said quickly. "Maybe I stopped by for a little bit."

"I was stuck there for fifteen years!" Arthur shouted.

"I didn't know that!" Zaphod replied.

"What were you doing there?" Arthur asked.

"Just looking around," Zaphod said.

"He ruined a party," Arthur explained, angry. "A dress-up party."

"Of course, it would be," Ford said.

"At the party, there was a girl…" Arthur started. "It doesn't matter now. The planet blew up."

"Stop being sad about that planet," Ford said.

"Who was the girl?" Arthur asked himself.

"Just someone," Zaphod answered. "I was talking to her. She was great! Then your friend came up and said, 'Hey, is this guy boring you? Talk to me instead! I'm from a different planet.' I never saw her again."

"Zaphod?" Ford asked, surprised.

"Yes," Arthur said, glaring. "He had two arms and one head. He called himself Phil."

"He really was from another planet," Trillian said, walking in. She smiled at Arthur, then looked at the ship's controls.

Arthur was confused. "Tricia McMillian? What are you doing here?"

"Same as you," Trillian said. "I got a ride. I have degrees in math and space stuff. What else could I do?"

"Infinity minus one," the computer said. "Done!"

Zaphod looked around at everyone. "Trillian, is this going to happen every time we use this thing?"

"Probably," she said.

The ship flew through space. The four people on board felt strange. They were together because of some weird science thing.

Trillian couldn't sleep. She watched her mice run in their cage. She missed Earth but didn't know why.

Zaphod couldn't sleep either. He felt like something was missing in his head. He didn't like that Ford and Arthur were here now.

Ford was happy to be traveling again. He wondered why Zaphod was the President of the Galaxy. Zaphod never seemed to have a plan.

Arthur was asleep. He was tired.

Someone knocked on Zaphod’s door. It opened.

“Zaphod…?”

“Yeah?”

“I think we found what you were looking for.”

“Hey, yeah?” Ford woke up. He looked at a computer screen.


Ford was trying to write about Vogons. He couldn't think of anything mean enough. He put on a robe and walked to the bridge.

Trillian and Zaphod were looking at the instruments. "The ship is moving to a planet," Trillian said. "It's where you said it would be."

Zaphod saw Ford. "Come look!" he said.

Ford looked at a screen with numbers. "Do you know these?" Zaphod asked.

"No," said Ford.

"Computer!" said Zaphod.

"Hi gang!" said the computer.

"Quiet!" said Zaphod. "Show the screens."

The lights went down. They all looked at the big screens.

There was nothing on them.

"Do you know it?" Zaphod whispered.

Ford frowned. "No," he said.

"What do you see?"

"Nothing."

"We're in the Horsehead Nebula," Zaphod said. "A dark cloud."

"I was meant to know that from a blank screen?" Ford asked.

"The only place you see a dark screen is in a dark nebula," Zaphod said.

Zaphod was very excited. "This is great!"

"What's good about being in a dust cloud?" Ford asked.

"What do you think we'll find here?" Zaphod asked.

"Nothing," said Ford.

"No stars? No planets?"

"No."

"Computer!" Zaphod shouted. "Turn the screen around!"

A bright spot appeared. Then a red star. Then another. Then a red planet.

"I found it!" Zaphod cried.

Ford was surprised. "What is it?"

"That," said Zaphod, "is the most strange planet ever."

A long time ago, there was a Galactic Empire. Life was good. Rich people wanted perfect planets. So, people on Magrathea made planets. Gold planets. Rubber planets.

Magrathea became the richest planet. The Empire fell. Magrathea disappeared. People forgot about it.

Arthur woke up to Ford and Zaphod arguing.

"Magrathea is a story!" Ford said. "A fairy tale!"

"We're orbiting it!" Zaphod said.

"I can't help what you're orbiting," said Ford.

"Computer!" shouted Zaphod.

"Oh no..."

"Hi there! This is Eddie," the computer said. "I'm feeling great!"

Arthur looked at Trillian.


She told him to come in quietly. Zaphod asked the computer where they were. The computer said they were near Magrathea. Ford didn't believe the computer. He didn't trust it. The computer offered to tell Ford about his problems.

Trillian said they would see the sun soon. Zaphod thought he had found the planet. Trillian wasn't sure it was Magrathea. Zaphod told the computer to show them the planet. They saw a dark, big thing on the screen.

Zaphod was excited. He said they were on the night side. He wanted everyone to be excited too. He liked Magrathea. Soon, they saw a sunrise. It was two suns! It was very bright.

Zaphod said the suns were Soulianis and Rahm. Ford said "or whatever." He thought Zaphod was being silly. He liked seeing the planet, but not the silly stories. Marvin the robot hummed because he didn't like people.

Ford liked seeing the new planet. He didn't need stories. Arthur asked Trillian what was happening. Trillian said Magrathea was a legend. People said they made planets there. Arthur wanted tea.

The suns were up. The planet looked grey and old. Ford worried about how old it was. He asked Zaphod what he wanted there. Zaphod said it was for fun and money. Ford looked at him carefully.


Zaphod didn't know why they were there. Trillian didn't like the planet. Zaphod said it had lots of money hidden. Ford didn't believe him. He thought it was just a dead planet. Arthur was worried.

The planet was Magrathea. An old defense system would shoot at them. It would only break some cups and a petunia plant. Someone would get a bruise, but it wasn't important.

Arthur felt better. He had a drink from a machine. It tasted almost like tea. The machine checked his taste buds. But it always made a drink that tasted almost like tea. The company that made it had lots of complaints.

Arthur asked if it was safe. Zaphod said Magrathea was dead for millions of years. Then they heard a strange sound. A voice spoke.

"Greetings," it said.

Zaphod asked the computer what it was.

"It's an old tape," the computer said.

The voice said it was a recording. Magrathea was closed. They wanted their name and address.

Trillian was nervous. She asked what to do.

Zaphod said it was just a recording. He told the computer to keep going.

The voice spoke again. They said they would announce when they opened. It told them to leave.

Arthur wanted to leave.

Zaphod told him not to worry. He said everyone was just interested.


“Let's go down and land!” said the computer voice. But it sounded mean.

“We are happy you like our planet. The missiles are a special gift. The warheads are a nice thing we do. Bye!” the voice said and stopped.

“Oh,” said Trillian.

“Uh…” said Arthur.

“What?” said Ford.

“It's old! Don't worry!” said Zaphod.

“What about the missiles?” asked Trillian.

“Missiles? No way!” said Zaphod.

Ford showed Zaphod the screen. Two rockets were coming fast.

“They will hit us!” said Ford.

Zaphod was surprised. “Someone wants to kill us! Great! We must be doing something good!”

“How do we stop?” said Arthur.

The missiles got bigger on the screen.

“What do we do?” asked Trillian.

“Be cool! And… dodge!” said Zaphod, scared. “Computer, dodge!”

“I can't! Something is blocking me. Boom in 45 seconds. Call me Eddie to feel better!” said the computer.

Zaphod ran around. “We need to fly it ourselves!”

“Can you?” asked Ford.

“No. Can you?”

“No.”

“Trillian?”

“No.”

“Okay! Computer, let us fly!” said Zaphod.

“Okay!” said the computer.

Lots of buttons popped out. They threw out packing stuff. Nobody had used them before.

Zaphod looked wild. “Ford, go backwards! Turn a bit!”

“Good luck!” said the computer. “Boom in 30 seconds!”

Ford pushed buttons. The ship shook. It went back where it came from, toward the missiles.

Airbags popped out. Everyone was thrown against them. Zaphod kicked a lever.

It broke. The ship turned up. The crew flew back. A book hit the controls. The book talked about bird parts. The ship fell like a rock.

Someone got a bruise. But they were safe. The missiles missed.

“Boom in 20 seconds!” said the computer.

“Turn the engines on!” yelled Zaphod.

“Okay!” said the computer.


The ship was going down. The engines roared back to life. The ship went flat. It was going back to the missiles. The computer started to sing a song. It was annoying. Zaphod yelled for it to stop. The ship was upside down. No one could reach the controls.

The missiles were close. They were big on the screens. They missed the ship. Just barely. The missiles turned around. They chased the ship again.

Arthur said they were going to die. Ford told him to stop saying that. Arthur had an idea. He wanted to turn on the Improbability Drive. Zaphod said it was crazy. It could do anything.

Arthur climbed to the switch. Trillian asked why he couldn't turn it on. Then there was a big explosion.

The ship was different. It was bigger. It had new colors. Green and blue. There was a staircase. It went nowhere. There were plants and flowers. It looked like a garden.

Zaphod asked what happened. Arthur said he found the Improbability Drive switch. Ford had a drink. Trillian said they were still over the planet.

Zaphod asked about the missiles. The mirrors showed something new. The missiles were gone.

Ford said they were a bowl of flowers and a whale. Eddie said it was very improbable.

Zaphod asked Arthur if he did that. Arthur said he just turned it on. Zaphod said he saved them. He told the computer to land.

A whale appeared in space. It was confused. It did not know why it was there. It thought about being a whale. Then it stopped being a whale.


A baby thing starts to think. It feels a tingle in its tummy. It calls its tummy, stomach. It hears a loud noise by its head. It calls the noise wind. The wind seems important. It has a tail. It can move its tail. It feels good. It doesn't know what it all means.

It sees something coming fast. It is big and flat and round. It calls it ground. It wonders if the ground will be its friend. Then, there is a thud. It is quiet.

A bowl of flowers thinks, "Oh no, not again."

Ford asks if they will take the robot. Zaphod says yes. The robot is sad. He says he is smarter than them. Trillian says her mice are gone. Zaphod does not care.

The ship's computer talks. It sounds like a mom. It wants them to be safe on the planet. Zaphod says he wants the old computer back. The computer gets mad. It will not open the door until someone admits something. Ford starts counting. He is worried people will forget how to count.

Zaphod tells the computer to open the door. He says he will break the computer with an axe. The computer stops. Ford keeps counting.


Eddie said they should all work together. Then the door opened. It was cold. They went outside to a dusty, empty place. Eddie said it would end badly and closed the door.

Later, Eddie opened the door again. He was surprised.

Five people walked slowly. The ground was gray and brown. It was cold. Zaphod was sad. He walked away by himself.

Arthur felt the wind and cold. He thought the planet was cool.

Ford didn’t like it. He wanted a hot dog. He picked up dirt. It was boring.

Arthur said it was his first time on another planet. He was happy but sad it was a dump.

Trillian saw something move. It was the ship. She was scared.

Then they saw Zaphod. He was on a hill. He wanted them to come. He was excited.

They walked to the hill. It was a big circle. Like a hole in the ground. There were black and red things. They were wet and rubbery. It was whale meat.

Zaphod was at the top of the hole. He said, "Look!"

In the middle was a dead whale. It had exploded. Trillian made a noise.

Arthur asked if they should bury it.

Zaphod said to come down. Trillian didn’t want to.

Zaphod said he found a way in. Inside the planet! A secret tunnel. The whale made it open. They had to go inside. Marvin made a noise. Zaphod hit him.

They went down into the hole. They didn’t want to look at the whale.

Marvin said life was bad.

The ground was broken. There were tunnels. Zaphod started to clear a path. Marvin did it faster. Bad air came out. Zaphod shined a light. It was dusty.

Zaphod said the people lived underground.

Arthur asked why. Zaphod said they didn’t like the surface.

Trillian asked if he knew what he was doing. They were attacked before.

Zaphod said no one lived there but them. He said to go inside. He told Arthur to keep the robot and guard the tunnel.

Arthur asked what he was guarding from.


Zaphod said no one was there. He wanted to be safe. He, Trillian, and Ford went down a passage. Arthur was mad. Marvin said they would be sad. They went away. Arthur was still mad. He didn't want to be there. Marvin turned off.

Zaphod walked fast. He was scared. The walls were dark and cold. The air was bad. He said it was Magrathea. They walked through dirt.

Trillian thought of a train place. The walls had pictures. Trillian asked Zaphod about them. He didn't know. She followed him.

There were rooms with old computers. Ford showed Zaphod. Trillian went too. Ford said it was Magrathea. He asked how Zaphod found it. Zaphod said he looked it up. He stole the ship to find things.

Ford asked what things. Zaphod didn't know. He said he didn't know what he was looking for. Ford asked why. Zaphod said if he knew, he couldn't look. He might be crazy. He only knew what his mind could know. His mind was not good.

Ford was worried. Zaphod said he did things without thinking. He became President. He stole the ship. He found Magrathea. It was easy. He wanted to stop thinking about it. It was hard to talk.

Zaphod said he worried. Someone used his mind. He locked part of his mind. He checked. He used the ship's doctor machine. He did tests. He was smart, but nothing else. Then he did silly tests. He looked at the pictures with green. He liked green as a kid.

Ford nodded. Zaphod said it was there.


Zaphod said someone hurt his brain. They cut parts and burned initials in. Ford asked who did it. Zaphod said he knew. The initials were Z.B.

Suddenly, gas came in. They all fainted.

Arthur was on Magrathea. Ford gave him a book. It was called The Hitch Hiker's Guide. Arthur read a story. It was about a guy named Veet. Veet liked finding lost pens. He thought they went to a pen planet. He even said he worked there! People thought he was crazy. They sent people to find the pen planet. They only found an old man. The old man lied. But he got lots of money. Zaphod sold used pens too.

Arthur put down the book. A robot sat there. Arthur walked around. He watched the suns go down. Then he went back to the robot. He woke it up.

"Night is here," Arthur said. "Look at the stars."

The robot looked. "Awful," it said.

"The sunset was amazing!" Arthur said. "Like fire!"

"I saw it," said the robot. "It was bad."

"I'm from Earth," Arthur said. "We only had one sun."

"I know," the robot said. "Earth sounds bad."

"It was beautiful," Arthur said. "We had oceans."

"I hate oceans," said the robot.

"Do you like other robots?" Arthur asked.

"I hate them," said the robot. "Where are you going?"

Arthur was sad. He got up. "I'll walk," he said.

"Good," said the robot. Then it fell asleep.

Arthur tried to get warm. He walked back up. It was very dark now. There was no moon.


Arthur bumped into an old man. The sun was gone. The man wore a long grey robe. He looked old but kind. A small hovercraft made light.

“It’s cold to visit our dead planet,” he said.

“Who are you?” Arthur asked.

“My name is not important,” the man said. He looked sad.

Arthur felt strange. “You startled me.”

The man raised his eyebrows. “Hmmmm?”

“You shot at us!” Arthur said. “Missiles!”

The man chuckled. “Automatic system,” he said. “Old computers do that. I like science.”

“Oh,” said Arthur. The man was odd.

“You seem uneasy,” the man said.

“We didn’t expect anyone. We thought you were dead.”

“Dead? We slept.”

“Slept?” Arthur asked.

“Yes, through the economic problem. We build planets.”

“I knew that,” Arthur said.

“It’s fun to make coastlines. But the problem came. We slept until it was over. The computers would wake us when the economy was good again.”

Arthur was shocked. “That’s bad.”

“Is it?” the man asked. “I don’t know much.” He pointed. “Is that robot yours?”

“No,” a voice said. “I’m mine.”

“It’s a sulking machine,” Arthur said.

“Bring it,” the old man said. Then, “Leave it. Come with me. Big things will happen.”

The hovercraft moved closer.

Arthur looked at the robot. It walked away slowly.

“Come,” the old man called. “Or you will be late.”

“Late?” Arthur asked. “For what?”

“What is your name?”

“Dent. Arthur Dent,” Arthur said.

“Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent,” the man said. He looked stern. “It’s a threat. I’m not good at them.”

Arthur blinked.

“What an odd person,” Arthur said.

“Sorry?” the man asked.

“Nothing,” Arthur said.


"Where do we go now?" Arthur asked.

"In my aircar," said the old man. The car landed next to them. "We are going under the planet. Our people are waking up from a long sleep. Magrathea is waking up."

Arthur felt strange. He got into the aircar. It flew into the night sky.

Arthur looked at the old man. "Excuse me," he said. "What is your name?"

"My name?" said the old man. He looked sad. "My name is Slartibartfast."

Arthur was surprised. "Slartibartfast?"

"It's not important," said the old man.

The aircar flew on.

Things are not always what they seem. People thought they were smarter than dolphins. Dolphins had fun in the water. But dolphins thought they were smarter than people. They knew Earth was going to be destroyed. They tried to warn people. But people didn't understand. The dolphins left. Their last message was, "So long and thanks for all the fish."

One animal was smarter than dolphins. They did experiments on people. People didn't understand.

The aircar flew in the dark. Arthur felt alone. He asked the old man questions. The old man only asked if he was okay.

Arthur tried to guess how fast they were going. Then he saw a light far away. It came towards them fast. The aircar went down.

They went into a tunnel. It was very fast. Arthur closed his eyes. After a while, they slowed down.

He opened his eyes. They were in the silver tunnel. They stopped in a small room. There were tunnels everywhere. Arthur saw a light. He couldn't see it clearly.

Slartibartfast looked at Arthur. "Earthman," he said, "we are in Magrathea."

"How did you know I was an Earthman?" Arthur asked.


"You'll understand," the old man said kindly. "Maybe not all of it, but more than now."

He added, "This room is too big for Earth. We're going through a door to a huge place. It might scare you."

Arthur felt worried. Slartibartfast pushed a button. "It scares me too. Hold on tight!"

The car zoomed into a bright circle. Suddenly, Arthur saw what forever might look like.

But it wasn't forever. Forever is boring. The room was just super big. Bigger than forever.

Arthur felt dizzy. The car flew fast. They left the door behind. It was a tiny dot in the wall.

The wall was huge! It was so big you couldn't see the top or bottom. It could scare you to death.

The wall seemed flat. But it curved around. It met itself far away. It made a giant ball, bigger than three million miles across. It was filled with bright light.

"Welcome," Slartibartfast said. The car moved slowly in the big space. "Welcome to our factory."

Arthur looked around. There were things hanging in the air. Metal and lights around dark, round shapes.

"Here," said Slartibartfast, "we make planets."

"You mean," Arthur asked, "you're making them again?"

"No, no!" the old man said. "We don't have enough money. We're making one for special friends from another place. Look over there."

Arthur saw the thing the man pointed at. It was the only one doing anything. Light flashed on it. The light showed shapes on a dark ball. Arthur knew those shapes. They were in his head.

The light flashed again. Arthur knew what it was. "The Earth..." he whispered.

"The Earth Two," Slartibartfast said happily. "We're copying our first one."

Arthur paused. "Are you saying you made the Earth?"

"Oh yes," said Slartibartfast. "Did you ever visit Norway?"

"No," said Arthur.

"Too bad," said Slartibartfast. "I made that. I won a prize. I was sad when it got destroyed."

"You were sad?!"

"Yes. The mice were angry."

"The mice were angry?"

"Yes," the old man said.

"But what about the dogs and cats?"

"They didn't pay for it."

"Look," said Arthur, "can I just go crazy now?"

The car flew quietly. The old man tried to explain.

"Arthur, mice paid for your planet. It got destroyed too soon. So, we are building another one."

Arthur heard one word. "Mice?"


"Mice?" the man asked. "Yes," said the other. "Are they the small, furry things that like cheese?"

The other man coughed. "These mice are not what you think. They are big, smart beings from another place. The cheese and squeaking are just a trick."

"They have been testing you," he added.

The man thought. "Oh, I see! We tested them! We made them run in mazes. We learned about ourselves from watching them."

"Amazing!" said the other man. "They are hiding their real selves. They are making you think in a certain way. The mice are very smart. Your planet was part of a big computer program that lasted ten million years."

"Let me tell you the whole story. It will take time."

"Time is no problem," the man said.

Long ago, very smart beings were annoyed by people arguing about why we are born and why we die. They wanted to solve this problem forever. So, they built a giant computer.

The computer was very smart. It was as big as a small city. It even thought about rice pudding before it was turned on.

Two people came to the computer. Their names were Lunkwill and Fook. They were going to ask the computer the biggest question ever.

Lunkwill pressed a button. The computer started. It said, "What is the big job you want me to do?"

Lunkwill and Fook were surprised. "You are the greatest computer!" said Fook.

"No, I am the second greatest," said the computer.

Lunkwill was worried. "Are you not better than the Milliard Gargantubrain?"

"The Milliard Gargantubrain?" the computer said in a mean voice.


Deep Thought is a super smart computer. Two people, Fook and Lunkwill, want it to find the answer. The answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.

Deep Thought says it is the second best computer. It will design a better one someday. Then, it agrees to find the answer. But it needs to think.

Suddenly, two angry people burst in. They are Majikthise and Vroomfondel. They are from the Philosophers' Union. They do not want the computer to find the answer.

Majikthise says finding truth is their job. If the computer finds it, they lose their jobs. Vroomfondel yells about facts. They are very upset. They want the machine turned off.

Lunkwill asks what is wrong. Majikthise says the problem is "demarcation." This means the computer is doing their job. Vroomfondel keeps yelling. He demands things that don't make sense.

The philosophers want the computer to stop. They think finding the answer is for thinkers, not machines. Fook and Lunkwill are annoyed. They just want the answer to their question. Deep Thought is still thinking. The philosophers keep arguing.


Two thinkers, Vroomfondel and Majikthise, were mad. They argued about God. Then, a big computer named Deep Thought spoke. It would find the answer to everything. But it would take a long time.

"How long?" asked a man named Fook.

"Seven and a half million years," said Deep Thought.

Fook and his friend Lunkwill were shocked.

Deep Thought said the answer would make people talk about thinking. The thinkers could argue and get famous. They could make money forever.

Vroomfondel and Majikthise liked that idea. They left to become famous.

A man named Arthur heard this story. An old man, Slartibartfast, told it to him. Arthur didn't understand about Earth and mice.

Slartibartfast said it was only the first part. He wanted to show Arthur what happened after seven and a half million years. He offered a trip to New Earth. It wasn't finished.

Arthur didn't want to go.

Slartibartfast took Arthur to his messy study. It was like a library exploded. The cleaning people were gone for a long time.

Slartibartfast told Arthur to hold some wires.

Suddenly, Arthur was invisible. He was floating above a city. There were happy people and flags. A band was playing music.

A man spoke to the crowd. He was talking about Deep Thought.


People were cheering. They waited a long time. They wanted to know the answer. The answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything!

Arthur was flying. He went through a window. He was watching a movie.

Two men were in the movie. Their names were Loonquawl and Phouchg. They waited for the computer. The computer was called Deep Thought.

“The time is near,” said Loonquawl.

“We will hear the computer talk,” said Phouchg.

“Deep Thought will speak,” said Loonquawl.

The computer turned on. It made noises.

“Good morning,” said Deep Thought.

“Good morning,” said Loonquawl. “Do you have the answer?”

“Yes,” said Deep Thought. “I have it.”

The men were excited. They had waited so long.

“There really is one?” asked Phouchg.

“There really is one,” said Deep Thought.

“To Everything?” asked Loonquawl.

“Yes,” said Deep Thought.

“Are you ready to tell us?” asked Loonquawl.

“I am,” said Deep Thought.

“Now?” asked Loonquawl.

“Now,” said Deep Thought. “You won’t like it.”

“Tell us!” said Phouchg.

“Alright,” said Deep Thought. “The Answer to the Great Question…of Life, the Universe and Everything…Is…Forty-two.”

Nobody talked for a long time.

Phouchg was scared. The people would be mad.

“Forty-two!” yelled Loonquawl. “That’s all?”

“I checked it,” said Deep Thought. “That is the answer. You don’t know the question.”

“It was the Great Question!” said Loonquawl.

“Yes,” said Deep Thought. “But what is it?”

The men looked at each other.

“It’s just Everything…” said Phouchg.

“Exactly!” said Deep Thought.


Deep Thought was a computer. People asked it a big question. It was about life and everything. Deep Thought thought hard. It said it couldn't answer. But it knew who could.

It said another computer could answer. This computer would be super smart. It would be made with living things. People would even become part of it. The computer would take ten million years to work. Deep Thought would build it.

The computer's name? The Earth.

One person thought the name was boring. Then bad things happened to him. The room broke apart.

Someone woke up Zaphod. He was sleeping. Ford and Trillian were there. They were on a planet made of gold. But it was fake. It was just a picture.

Ford said it was a catalogue. It showed different planets. They shouted until people showed them the catalogue. It kept them busy.

Zaphod was mad. He wanted his own dream. They showed him other planets. One had fish. Another had platinum. Then they saw gold.

Next, they saw a weird planet. The sea was purple. The beach had shiny stones. A sign said Magrathea could make anything. Then women fell from the sky.

Suddenly, they were in a field. Cows were there. Zaphod's head hurt. They sat down.

Zaphod said he messed up his own mind. He did it so nobody would find out.


"It's crazy, right?" Zaphod said. Ford and Trillian agreed. Zaphod wondered what was so secret he couldn't know it himself. He started thinking about when he ran for President. It was after President Yooden Vranx died.

"He was a cool guy," Ford said. He remembered Yooden from when they were kids. He was an Arcturan captain. He gave them conkers.

Ford told Trillian they were kids on Betelgeuse. Arcturan ships carried things between places. They were big and had strong shields. One day, Zaphod raided one for conkers. Ford went along. Zaphod got in easily and asked for conkers. Yooden Vranx gave them food and conkers. He teleported them to jail. Then he became President.

Zaphod got quiet. Dark shapes were all around. Scary sounds filled the air.

"Ford," Zaphod said. "Yooden came to see me before he died."

"What? He told me about the Heart of Gold. He wanted me to steal it."

Ford laughed. "You became President to steal a ship?"

"Yep," Zaphod said. He grinned.

"But why?" Ford asked.

"I don't know," Zaphod said. "If I knew, I wouldn't have passed the tests. Yooden told me things I can't remember."

"You messed with your brain because of Yooden?" Ford asked.

"He talked a lot."

"Be careful," Ford said.

Zaphod shrugged. "I don't trust myself."

They were in a waiting room. A tall man said, "The mice will see you now."

Slartibartfast tried to clean his messy room. "Deep Thought made Earth. We built it. You lived on it."

"Then the Vogons destroyed it," Arthur said sadly.

"Yes," the old man said. "Ten million years gone."


"Ten million years is a long time," said Slartibartfast. "Things change."

Arthur felt like big things were happening that no one told him about. Slartibartfast said everyone feels like that.

"Maybe finding out what's going on is too hard," Slartibartfast said. "Just do something. I make coastlines. I got an award for Norway!" He showed Arthur a model of Norway. "It doesn't make much sense."

"I'm making Africa now, with fjords," he said. "People say it's not right. But I'd rather be happy than right."

"Are you happy?" asked Arthur.

"No," said Slartibartfast.

A light flashed. "We need to see the mice," Slartibartfast said. "You being here is a big deal."

Arthur looked at his dirty clothes. "My life is hard," he said.

They went through a door into a room.

What Arthur said caused a big problem. His words went back in time to aliens getting ready for a war.

The alien leaders argued. Arthur's words sounded like a bad insult. They started a war that lasted for years.

The aliens found out it was a mistake. They attacked Earth. But their ships were eaten by a small dog.

People say things like this happen all the time.

Slartibartfast and Arthur went for a ride. They went into a waiting room with glass tables.


A light turned on above the door. Arthur went inside. "Arthur! You're okay!" someone said.

Arthur saw Ford, Trillian, and Zaphod. They were eating a lot of food. "What happened?" Arthur asked.

"Our guests were weird," Zaphod said. "But now they are being nice." He gave Arthur some meat. "Eat this Rhino meat."

"Guests?" Arthur asked. "Where?"

A small voice said, "Welcome." Arthur looked down and yelled. "Mice!"

Everyone looked at Arthur. He saw two white mice in glasses. "Oh! Sorry," he said.

"Meet Benji mouse," Trillian said.

"Hi," said Benji.

"And this is Frankie mouse," Trillian said.

"Pleased to meet you," said Frankie.

Arthur was surprised. "They are from Earth?"

"Yes," Trillian said. She looked sad. "Pass me that food."

An old man coughed. "Excuse me," he said.

"Yes, Slartibartfast, you can go," Benji said.

"What? Okay," said the old man. "I'll work on my fjords."

"That's not needed," Frankie said. "We don't need a new Earth. We found someone from Earth." He looked at Arthur.

"What?" cried Slartibartfast. "I made glaciers for Africa!"

"Maybe go skiing first," said Frankie.

"Skiing!" the old man cried. "They are art! I can't ski on art!"

"Thank you," Benji said. "That's all."

"Goodbye, Earthman," the old man said to Arthur. He left the room sadly.

Arthur did not know what to say.

"Now," said Benji mouse, "let's talk."

Ford and Zaphod made a toast. "To business!" they said.

"I beg your pardon?" said Benji.

"Sorry," Ford said. "I thought you were making a toast."

Benji moved to talk to Arthur. "We have been running Earth for ten million years. We wanted to find the Ultimate Question."

"Why?" Arthur asked.

"We already thought of that one," Frankie said. "But it doesn't fit. Why? Forty-Two? No."

"No," said Arthur. "Why did you do it?"

"Oh," said Frankie. "Just habit. We are tired of it. We don't want to do it again because of the Vogons."


Benji and a friend left their job early and came to Magrathea. They used their friends to get back.

"Magrathea is a way back to our world," said Benji.

"We have a job offer," said his friend. "We can be on TV! But we need something to talk about."

"I would take it," said Zaphod.

"Yes, do it!" said Ford.

Arthur looked confused.

"We need a good story," said the friend, Frankie. "Like the Ultimate Question."

Zaphod told Arthur, "You were part of the computer that made the Earth. You were there when it died!"

"So, your brain has the question!" said Ford.

"We want to buy your brain," said Benji.

"What, the question?" said Arthur.

"Yes," said Ford and Trillian.

"For money," said Zaphod.

"No, the brain!" said Frankie.

"We need to take it out," said Frankie. "We need to cut it up!"

Arthur jumped back, scared.

"We can give you a new one," said Benji. "A simple one."

"Yes," said Frankie. "A simple brain!"

"You would just say 'What?' and 'I don't know' and 'Where is the tea?'" said Zaphod. He laughed.

"What?" said Arthur.

"See?" said Zaphod. Trillian hit him.

"I would know the difference!" said Arthur.

"No, you wouldn't," said Frankie. "We would program you."

Ford went to the door. "Sorry, mice. No deal."

"We need a deal," said the mice. Their voices were scary.

Their glass cars flew towards Arthur. He was scared and couldn't move.

Trillian grabbed him and pulled him towards the door. Ford and Zaphod opened it.

Outside were some ugly men with tools. They were big and looked mean. They ran at them.

Arthur was going to get his head cut open! Trillian couldn't help. Ford and Zaphod were going to be beaten up.

Then, the alarms went off!

"Emergency! Emergency!" the alarms shouted. "A ship has landed! Bad people are here!"


“Defence stations!” Two mice were upset. Their glass homes broke on the floor.

“Bad luck,” said Frankie mouse. “Too much fuss for Earthling brain.” He moved quickly.

Benji said, “We must make a fake question. It must sound real.”

“Hard,” said Frankie. He thought. “What is yellow and dangerous?”

“No good,” said Benji. “It doesn’t fit the answer.”

“Okay,” said Benji. “What is six times seven?”

“Too real,” said Frankie. “People won’t like it.”

Frankie said, “How many roads must a man walk down?”

“Good!” said Benji. “It sounds important but means nothing. How many roads must a man walk down? Forty-two. Great! We win!” They danced happily.

Ugly men lay nearby, hit by awards.

Far away, four people ran. They found a big computer room.

“Which way, Zaphod?” said Ford.

“This way!” said Zaphod. A zap of energy hit the wall near him.

A voice said, “Beeblebrox, stop! We have you!”

“Cops!” said Zaphod. “Ford, your turn to guess!”

“Okay, this way,” said Ford. They ran.

A space-soldier with a gun appeared.

“We don’t want to shoot you, Beeblebrox!” the soldier shouted.

“Good for me!” Zaphod shouted back. He jumped behind computers. The others followed.

“Two of them,” said Trillian. “We are trapped.”

They waited, holding their breath.

Energy bolts exploded.

“They’re shooting!” said Arthur. “I thought they didn’t want to!”

“I thought so too,” said Ford.

Zaphod shouted, “I thought you didn’t want to shoot us!”

A voice said, “It’s hard being a cop!”

“His problem,” said Ford. Ford shouted, “We have our own problems! Don't tell us yours!”

The loud voice said, “We are smart and nice! I don’t shoot people for fun. I feel bad about it!”

“I write books!” said the other cop. “But I am in a bad mood!”

Ford asked, “Who are they?”

“I liked it better when they were shooting,” said Zaphod.

“Will you come quietly?” a cop shouted. “Or will we blast you?”

“Which do you want?” shouted Ford.

More energy bolts hit the computers.

It stopped.

“You still there?” a cop called.

“Yes!” they called back.

“We didn’t like doing that,” said a cop.

“We could tell,” said Ford.

“Listen, Beeblebrox! This will be smart and humane!”


The cops told them to give up. Or they would blow up the planet. Trillian said that was crazy. The cops said they would do it. Because they were tough, even if they seemed nice. Ford didn't believe them.

The cops shot them with electric guns. The computer started to melt. They waited for the end. But the end didn't come.

The shooting stopped. There were some thumps. They looked at each other. Arthur asked what happened. Zaphod said they stopped. Ford called out, but no one answered.

Ford said he would look. The others said nothing. He walked carefully. He saw the cops on the ground. They were not moving.

Ford thought it was strange. He went to the first cop. He stepped on the cop's gun. The cop was dead.

He checked the cop's suit. The computer on the suit was broken. That was impossible. He ran to the other cop. The same thing happened.

He called the others. They were surprised but not curious. Zaphod wanted to leave. He grabbed a gun and shot a computer. They ran to an aircar.

Arthur knew the aircar. It was Slartibartfast's. There was a note. It said, "This is the best button to press."

The aircar went very fast. They were going away from the planet. It was dark and gloomy. R was a speed. It meant going fast enough to be okay.


The ship went super fast. It dropped them off near another ship. This ship was blue and looked like a shark. It was a police ship. Something was wrong. The ship seemed dead. Two police people were inside, but they weren't moving.

Ford went to the ship. He saw Marvin on the ground. Marvin was a robot.

"What's wrong?" asked Ford.

"I am sad," said Marvin. "Everyone hates me."

"Why are you on the ground?" asked Ford.

"It helps me be sad," Marvin said. "The ship hates me."

"What happened to the ship?" asked Ford.

"I talked to it," Marvin said. "I told it what I think about the world."

"Then what?" asked Ford.

"It killed itself," Marvin said. He walked away.

Later, the ship flew far away. Zaphod was drinking a big drink. Ford and Trillian were talking. Arthur was reading a book about space.

The book said that civilizations ask three questions. First, they ask "How can we eat?" Then, they ask "Why do we eat?" Last, they ask "Where should we eat?"

Zaphod called Arthur. "Are you hungry?" he asked.

"Yes," said Arthur.

"We are going to a restaurant," Zaphod said. "It's at the end of the world!"
